## Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing Required

Since screenshot fixtures need to be manually created (PNG images), the following manual tests should be performed:

#### Test 1: Verify Read Tool Image Support

**Objective**: Confirm Claude Code's Read tool can load and analyze images

**Steps**:
1. Create a simple button screenshot (or use any PNG image)
2. Save to `tests/fixtures/screenshots/button-test.png`
3. In Claude Code conversation, run:
   ```
   Please use the Read tool to load tests/fixtures/screenshots/button-test.png
   and describe what you see in the image.
   ```

**Expected Result**:
- Read tool successfully loads image
- Claude provides visual description of image contents
- No errors about unsupported format

**Verification**:
- [ ] Read tool loads PNG without errors
- [ ] Claude describes image contents accurately
- [ ] Visual analysis capability confirmed

---

#### Test 2: Simple Button Vision Analysis

**Objective**: Test structured vision analysis with single component

**Prerequisites**:
- button-test.png exists (simple button with text)

**Steps**:
1. Invoke vision analysis following command documentation
2. Request structured JSON output per the vision prompt format
3. Parse and validate response

**Test Prompt**:
```
Please analyze this screenshot following the vision analysis structure from
/fluxwing-import-screenshot command (Step B).

Screenshot: tests/fixtures/screenshots/button-test.png

Return structured JSON with:
- screen object
- components array (expect 1 button component)
- composition object

Use exact JSON format from the command documentation.
```

**Expected JSON Output**:
```json
{
  "screen": {
    "type": "simple-component",
    "name": "Button Component",
    "description": "Single button component",
    "layout": "centered"
  },
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "submit-button",
      "type": "button",
      "category": "atomic",
      "visualProperties": {
        "width": 15-25,
        "height": 3,
        "borderStyle": "rounded",
        "textContent": "Submit"
      },
      "states": ["default", "hover", "disabled"],
      "accessibility": {
        "role": "button",
        "label": "Submit button"
      }
    }
  ],
  "composition": {
    "atomicComponents": ["submit-button"],
    "compositeComponents": [],
    "screenComponents": []
  }
}
```

**Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Response is valid JSON
- [ ] All required fields present
- [ ] Component ID is kebab-case
- [ ] Width/height are reasonable numbers (1-200, 1-100)
- [ ] Border style is from allowed list
- [ ] States array contains valid state names
- [ ] Type is "button" (from allowed types)
- [ ] Category is "atomic"
- [ ] Accessibility has role and label
- [ ] Composition arrays present and correct

#### Test 3: Multi-Component Login Form Analysis

**Objective**: Test complex multi-component extraction and hierarchy

**Prerequisites**:
- login-test.png exists (email input, password input, submit button)

**Steps**:
1. Invoke vision analysis with login form screenshot
2. Request structured JSON output
3. Verify component hierarchy (atomic → composite)
4. Validate composition relationships

**Test Prompt**:
```
Please analyze this login form screenshot following the vision analysis structure
from /fluxwing-import-screenshot command.

Screenshot: tests/fixtures/screenshots/login-test.png

Expected components:
- Email input (atomic)
- Password input (atomic)
- Submit button (atomic)
- Login form container (composite)

Return structured JSON with all components and hierarchy.
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Multiple atomic components extracted (3+)
- Composite component identified (login-form)
- Screen component added (login-screen)
- Composition arrays correctly populated
- Visual properties reasonable for each component

**Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Multiple components in array (3-5 expected)
- [ ] Atomic components: email-input, password-input, submit-button
- [ ] Composite component: login-form
- [ ] All IDs unique and kebab-case
- [ ] composition.atomicComponents lists atomic IDs
- [ ] composition.compositeComponents lists composite IDs
- [ ] All referenced IDs exist in components array
- [ ] Category consistency (atomic in atomic array, etc.)

#### Test 4: Error Handling - Unclear Screenshot

**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling for poor quality images

**Prerequisites**:
- unclear-test.png exists (blurry/low-res image)

**Steps**:
1. Attempt vision analysis with unclear image
2. Observe error handling behavior
3. Verify actionable error message

**Test Prompt**:
```
Please analyze this screenshot following the vision analysis structure.

Screenshot: tests/fixtures/screenshots/unclear-test.png

If screenshot quality is insufficient, fail gracefully with helpful message.
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Vision analysis recognizes poor quality
- Returns error message (not malformed JSON)
- Provides actionable suggestions
- Does not attempt file generation

**Error Message Should Include**:
- Clear indication of problem (unclear, low quality, etc.)
- Suggested resolution (higher res, better contrast, etc.)
- Supported formats reminder
- Minimum resolution guidance (800x600)

**Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Error detected and reported
- [ ] Error message is clear and actionable
- [ ] Suggests specific improvements
- [ ] Does not crash or produce malformed output

---

#### Test 5: Validation Logic Testing

**Objective**: Verify validation catches various error conditions

**Test Cases**:

**A. Missing Required Field**
- Remove `accessibility` from a component
- Expect validation error: "Component 'X' missing 'accessibility' object"

**B. Invalid Data Type**
- Set width to string "20" instead of number 20
- Expect error: "Component 'X': width must be a number"

**C. Out of Range Value**
- Set width to 300
- Expect error: "Component 'X': width must be 1-200 (got 300)"

**D. Invalid Component Type**
- Set type to "hamburger" (not in allowed list)
- Expect error: "Component 'X': invalid type 'hamburger'"

**E. Non-Kebab-Case ID**
- Set ID to "submitButton" (camelCase)
- Expect error: "Component ID 'submitButton' must be kebab-case"

**F. Duplicate IDs**
- Two components with same ID "submit-button"
- Expect error: "Duplicate component IDs found: submit-button"

**G. Category Mismatch**
- Component in atomicComponents array but category="composite"
- Expect error: "Component 'X' in atomicComponents array but has category 'composite'"

**H. Missing Reference**
- composition.atomicComponents references "email-input"
- But no component with id="email-input" exists
- Expect error: "Composition references unknown atomic component: 'email-input'"

**Validation Checks**:
- [ ] All 8 test cases produce expected error messages
- [ ] Errors reference specific field/component
- [ ] Error messages explain what's wrong
- [ ] Suggested fixes are actionable

## Known Limitations

### Screenshot Fixture Creation

**Issue**: Cannot programmatically create PNG screenshots in current environment

**Impact**: Manual testing required for vision analysis workflow

**Workaround Options**:
1. Create fixtures manually using HTML/CSS + screenshot tool
2. Use existing UI screenshots from web/apps
3. Generate using design tools (Figma export)

**Required Actions**:
- User must create test fixtures following `tests/fixtures/screenshots/README.md`
- Run manual tests 1-5 above
- Document results

### Vision Analysis Consistency

**Issue**: Claude's vision analysis may vary between runs

**Mitigation**:
- Structured prompt format reduces variance
- Validation catches malformed responses
- Clear JSON schema guides output format

**Testing Strategy**:
- Run same screenshot multiple times
- Verify consistent component identification
- Check ID naming stability
- Validate hierarchy detection
