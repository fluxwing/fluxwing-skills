# Final Fix - Plugin Loading Issue Resolved

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Issue:** Plugin failed to load with "manifest conflicts" error
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Root Cause

The marketplace and plugin directories contained **`.claude/` directories** with `settings.local.json` files. These were leftover from when the directories were being used as Claude Code project workspaces during development.

**The conflict:**
- `.claude/` = Claude Code **project configuration**
- `.claude-plugin/` = Plugin **manifest directory**

The plugin loader was confused by having both types of configuration in the same directories.

## The Fix

```bash
# Removed conflicting project configuration directories
rm -rf /Users/tranqy/projects/fluxwing-marketplace/.claude
rm -rf /Users/tranqy/projects/fluxwing-marketplace/fluxwing/.claude
```

## What Was Removed

### At marketplace root (`/.claude/`):
- `settings.local.json` with permissions configuration

### At plugin root (`/fluxwing/.claude/`):
- `settings.local.json` with extensive permissions and git commit templates

Both of these were development artifacts, not part of the plugin specification.

## Correct Final Structure

```
fluxwing-marketplace/
├── .claude-plugin/              ✓ Correct - marketplace manifest
│   └── marketplace.json
├── fluxwing/
│   ├── .claude-plugin/          ✓ Correct - plugin manifest
│   │   └── plugin.json
│   ├── commands/                ✓ Plugin components
│   ├── agents/
│   └── data/
└── [documentation]

(NO .claude/ directories anywhere)
```

## Complete List of All Fixes

### 1. ✅ Removed Conflicting .claude Directories (THIS FIX)
- **Problem:** Project config directories confused plugin loader
- **Impact:** "manifest conflicts" error on plugin load
- **Solution:** Removed all `.claude/` directories

### 2. ✅ Removed CLI Tool Implementation
- **Problem:** `uxscii/` subdirectory with full TypeScript project
- **Impact:** Plugin bloat, confusion about what's needed
- **Solution:** Removed entire `uxscii/` directory

### 3. ✅ Removed Empty Directories
- **Problem:** Empty `hooks/` and `mcp/` directories
- **Impact:** Could confuse plugin loader
- **Solution:** Removed both empty directories

### 4. ✅ Fixed Frontmatter (Previously)
- **Problem:** Extra fields in command/agent markdown files
- **Impact:** Non-compliant with spec
- **Solution:** Removed `author`, `version`, `tools` fields from frontmatter

### 5. ✅ Cleaned plugin.json (Previously)
- **Problem:** Extra fields like `keywords`, `repository`
- **Impact:** May have confused loader
- **Solution:** Kept only required fields

## Testing Instructions

Now that the fix is applied:

### Step 1: Restart Claude Code
**Important:** Must restart to clear cached plugin state

### Step 2: Re-add Marketplace (if needed)
```bash
/plugin marketplace add /Users/tranqy/projects/fluxwing-marketplace
```

### Step 3: Verify Marketplace
```bash
/plugin marketplace list
```
Expected: `fluxwing-marketplace` with 1 plugin available

### Step 4: Install Plugin
```bash
/plugin install fluxwing
```
Expected: Success message without errors

### Step 5: Restart Again
Required for plugin to fully load

### Step 6: Verify Success
```bash
/plugin list
```
Expected: `fluxwing` shown as installed and enabled

```bash
/help
```
Expected: Four new commands:
- `/fluxwing-create`
- `/fluxwing-library`
- `/fluxwing-scaffold`
- `/fluxwing-validate`

### Step 7: Test Command
```bash
/fluxwing-library
```
Expected: Component library browser launches

## Why This Happened

During plugin development, the directories were being used as Claude Code projects, which automatically created `.claude/` directories for project configuration. These should have been removed (or added to `.gitignore`) before attempting to use the directory as a plugin marketplace.

## Prevention

Add to `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
.claude/
!.claude-plugin/
```

This ensures:
- ✓ `.claude/` (project config) is ignored
- ✓ `.claude-plugin/` (plugin manifest) is kept

## Success Criteria

✅ No "manifest conflicts" error
✅ Plugin loads successfully
✅ Commands appear in `/help`
✅ Plugin persists after restart
✅ No error messages in logs
