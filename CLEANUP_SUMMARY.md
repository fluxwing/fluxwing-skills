# Fluxwing Plugin Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Objective:** Remove all references to uxscii/uxm CLI tools that users don't have access to

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Documentation Files

#### README.md (fluxwing/README.md)
- **Updated:** "Requirements" section
  - Changed "No CLI tools required" to "Everything you need is bundled in the plugin"
  - Emphasized self-contained nature

#### CLAUDE.md (fluxwing/CLAUDE.md)
- **Removed:** Entire "Working with uxscii CLI" section (35+ lines)
  - Build/test instructions
  - CLI usage examples
  - npm commands
- **Updated:** Development commands section
  - Replaced "For Plugin Development" and "For uxscii CLI Development" with single "Working with the Plugin" section
- **Updated:** Testing philosophy
  - Removed Jest/ts-jest references
  - Focused on plugin validation
- **Updated:** Version control notes
  - Removed node_modules references
  - Removed uxscii subdirectory versioning mention

#### ARCHITECTURE.md (fluxwing/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- No changes needed (already plugin-focused)

### 2. Data Documentation Files

#### UXSCII_README.md (fluxwing/data/docs/UXSCII_README.md)
- **Removed:** Entire "CLI Tools" section (28 lines)
  - npm run dev commands
  - validate, lint, compress, diff examples
  - stdin usage examples
- **Replaced with:** Simple statement about AI tools building on the specification

### 3. Specification Documents

#### UXSCII_AGENT_GUIDE.md
- **Status:** LEFT AS-IS (with note)
- **Reason:** This is a comprehensive UXSCII specification document (~1300 lines)
- **Contains:** CLI command examples throughout (validate, lint, template, etc.)
- **Recommendation:** Add disclaimer clarifying this is a language specification reference, not user-facing documentation

#### UXSCII_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md
- **Status:** TO BE REVIEWED
- **Contains:** Schema definitions and validation rules
- **Expected:** Minimal CLI references (mainly `.uxm` format explanations)

### 4. Command Files

All command files (fluxwing/commands/*.md):
- **Status:** VERIFIED CLEAN
- **Content:** Focus on `/fluxwing-*` commands
- **No inappropriate CLI references found**

### 5. Agent Files

All agent files (fluxwing/agents/*.md):
- **Status:** VERIFIED CLEAN
- **Content:** Focus on autonomous workflows using plugin tools
- **No inappropriate CLI references found**

### 6. Example Files

Example .uxm files (fluxwing/data/examples/*.uxm):
- **Status:** VERIFIED CLEAN
- **Content:** Pure JSON metadata, no CLI usage instructions
- **No changes needed**

## What Remains

### Acceptable References

The following terms/concepts SHOULD remain as they are part of the standard:

1. **"uxscii"** - The format/standard name (like "HTML" or "CSS")
2. **".uxm files"** - The file format extension
3. **"uxscii standard"** - References to the markup language specification
4. **"uxscii components"** - Components built using the standard

### Files with Specification Examples

These files contain CLI examples as part of the UXSCII language specification:
- `UXSCII_AGENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive spec guide (~1300 lines)
- Potentially `UXSCII_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` - Schema documentation

**Recommendation:** Add clear disclaimers that these are specification documents, not user instructions for the Fluxwing plugin.

## uxscii/ Subdirectory

### Current Status
- Location: `/fluxwing/uxscii/`
- Contents: Standalone CLI implementation with TypeScript source, tests, package.json
- Size: Full Node.js project with dependencies

### Options

**Option A: Remove Entirely**
- Users don't need it for the plugin
- Reduces confusion
- Smaller plugin size
- **Downside:** Loses reference implementation

**Option B: Document as Optional/Standalone**
- Add clear README explaining it's separate from plugin
- Note that users don't need to build/install it
- Clarify it's for developers/researchers interested in the spec
- **Downside:** Still present and potentially confusing

**Recommendation:** **Option B** - Keep but clearly document as standalone/optional

## Testing Verification

### Commands to Verify Cleanup

```bash
# Check for inappropriate CLI references
cd /Users/tranqy/projects/fluxwing-marketplace/fluxwing

# Should find minimal/no results (excluding spec docs)
grep -r "npm run dev" --exclude-dir=uxscii --exclude="*AGENT_GUIDE.md" .
grep -r "uxscii validate" --exclude-dir=uxscii --exclude="*AGENT_GUIDE.md" .
grep -r "uxscii lint" --exclude-dir=uxscii --exclude="*AGENT_GUIDE.md" .
grep -r "uxm " --exclude-dir=uxscii .
```

## Key Messages for Users

### What Users Should Know

1. **Fluxwing is self-contained** - No external tools required
2. **uxscii is a standard** - Like HTML, it's a format specification
3. **Use `/fluxwing-*` commands** - These handle everything within Claude Code
4. **No installation needed** - Just install the plugin from marketplace

### What Users Don't Need

1. ~~Installing uxscii CLI~~
2. ~~Running npm commands~~
3. ~~Building TypeScript~~
4. ~~Installing uxm tool~~

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Add disclaimer to UXSCII_AGENT_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Review UXSCII_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md for CLI references
- [ ] Create uxscii/README.md explaining it's standalone
- [ ] Final grep verification for "npm run dev", "uxm ", "uxscii validate" patterns
- [ ] Update .gitignore if uxscii/ directory decisions change

## Summary

The cleanup successfully removed user-facing references to CLI tools they don't have access to. The plugin now clearly presents itself as self-contained, with validation handled by `/fluxwing-validate` and other plugin commands. Specification documents remain for reference but should be clearly marked as such.

**Result:** Users can use Fluxwing without any external dependencies or CLI tools.
